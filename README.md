# iRSVPred-2.0
iRSVPred 2.0: It is an update of the iRSVPred web server that is trained and evaluated with ten varieties of major basmati paddy seeds images. In order to enhance the accuracy of the iRSVPred predictive models and easy access by the users, we have developed iRSVPred 2.0.

## Also known as [Baspred 2.0]((____)) - available on [Play Store](____)

iRSVPred 2.0 has been developed which provides a single model for prediction. The latest model is faster in terms of prediction speed, more accurate in prediction and provides a single classification prediction result with the probabilities for all 10 paddy varieties along with the Unknown class of images. These include Pusa basmati 1121, Pusa basmati 1509, Pusa basmati 1637, CSR 30 (salt-tolerant basmati), DHBT-3, PB-1, PB-6, BAS-370, 1718, and 1728.

## Requirements for Android App

The project works well with minimum Android 4.2 \
Java was used for the backend and XML for frontend.\
Mininum SDK 17, thereby supporting Android 4.2 and above.\

PhotoView:2.3.0 – to provide zoom in and zoom out feature\
Volley:1.1.1 – to send user data\
Youtube Android Player API – to play the YouTube tutorial video (Obsolete) \
Jsoup:1.12.1 – for data extraction

## Build
1. Install Android studio 4.0.0
2. Install the required SDK and libraries.
3. sync
4. Replace the commented URL section in ServerConnectionActivity.java and ContactUsActivity.java and add your custom URLs.
