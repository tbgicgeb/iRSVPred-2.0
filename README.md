# iRSVPred-2.0
iRSVPred 2.0: It is an update of the iRSVPred web server that is trained and evaluated with ten varieties of major basmati paddy seeds images. In order to enhance the accuracy of the iRSVPred predictive models and easy access by the users, we have developed iRSVPred 2.0 (web server and android application).

iRSVPred 2.0 has been developed which provides a single model for prediction. The latest model is faster in terms of prediction speed, more accurate in prediction and provides a single classification prediction result with the probabilities for all 10 paddy varieties along with the Unknown class of images. These include Pusa basmati 1121, Pusa basmati 1509, Pusa basmati 1637, CSR 30 (salt-tolerant basmati), DHBT-3, PB-1, PB-6, BAS-370, 1718, and 1728.
